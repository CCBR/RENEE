Overview","text":"<p>RENEE is a comprehensive, open-source RNA-seq pipeline that relies on technologies like Docker1 and Singularity2... now called Apptainer to maintain the highest-level of reproducibility. The pipeline consists of a series of data processing and quality-control steps orchestrated by Snakemake3, a flexible and scalable workflow management system, to submit jobs to a cluster or cloud provider (coming soon!).</p> <p>RENEE can be run locally on a compute instance, on-premise using a cluster, or on the cloud using AWS (coming soon!). A user can define the method or mode of execution. The pipeline can submit jobs to a cluster using a job scheduler like SLURM, or run on AWS using Tibanna (feature coming soon!). A hybrid approach ensures the pipeline is accessible to all users.</p> <p>A bioinformatics pipeline is more than the sum of its data processing steps. A pipeline without quality-control steps provides a myopic view of the potential sources of variation within your data (i.e., biological verses technical sources of variation). RENEE pipeline is composed of a series of quality-control and data processing steps.</p> <p> Fig 1. An Overview of the Quantification and Quality-control Pipeline. Gene and isoform counts are quantified and a series of QC-checks are performed to assess the quality of the data. This pipeline stops at the generation of a raw counts matrix, which is input to the next sub-workflow. To run the pipeline, a user must select their raw data directory (i.e. the location to their FastQ files), a reference genome, and output directory (i.e. the location where the pipeline performs the analysis). Quality-control information is summarized across all samples in the MultiQC and RNA report.</p>"},{"location":"#3-pipeline","title":"3. Pipeline","text":"<p>The accuracy of the downstream interpretations made from transcriptomic data are highly dependent on initial sample library. Unwanted sources of technical variation, which if not accounted for properly, can influence the results.</p> <p>In addition to generating a MultiQC report, the RENEE pipeline also generates a rNA Report to interactively allow users to identify problematic samples prior to performing any downstream analysis. RENEE's comprehensive quality-control helps ensure your results are reliable and reproducible across experiments. In the data processing steps, RENEE quantifies gene and isoform expression and predicts gene fusions. Please note that the detection of alternative splicing events and variant calling will be incorporated in a later release.</p>"},{"location":"#31-quality-control","title":"3.1 Quality Control","text":"<p>Quality Control FastQC4 is used to assess the sequencing quality. FastQC is run twice, before and after adapter trimming. It generates a set of basic statistics to identify problems that can arise during sequencing or library preparation. FastQC will summarize per base and per read QC metrics such as quality scores and GC content. It will also summarize the distribution of sequence lengths and will report the presence of adapter sequences.</p> <p>Kraken25 and FastQ Screen6 are used to screen for various sources of contamination. During the process of sample collection to library preparation, there is a risk for introducing wanted sources of DNA. FastQ Screen compares your sequencing data to a set of different reference genomes to determine if there is contamination. It allows a user to see if the composition of your library matches what you expect. Also, if there are high levels of microbial contamination, Kraken can provide an estimation of the taxonomic composition. Kraken can be used in conjunction with Krona7 to produce interactive reports.</p> <p>Preseq8 is used to estimate the complexity of a library for each samples. If the duplication rate is very high, the overall library complexity will be low. Low library complexity could signal an issue with library preparation where very little input RNA was over-amplified or the sample may be degraded.</p> <p>Picard9 can be used to estimate the duplication rate, and it has another particularly useful sub-command called CollectRNAseqMetrics which reports the number and percentage of reads that align to various regions: such as coding, intronic, UTR, intergenic and ribosomal regions. This is particularly useful as you would expect a library constructed with ploy(A)-selection to have a high percentage of reads that map to coding regions. Picard CollectRNAseqMetrics will also report the uniformity of coverage across all genes, which is useful for determining whether a sample has a 3' bias (observed in ploy(A)-selection libraries containing degraded RNA).</p> <p>RSeQC10 is another particularity useful package that is tailored for RNA-seq data. It is used to calculate the inner distance between paired-end reads and calculate TIN values for a set of canonical protein-coding transcripts. A median TIN value is calucated for each sample, which analogous to a computationally derived RIN.</p> <p>MultiQC11 is used to aggregate the results of each tool into a single interactive report.</p>"},{"location":"#32-data-processing","title":"3.2 Data Processing","text":"<p>Cutadapt12 is used to remove adapter sequences, perform quality trimming, and remove very short sequences that would otherwise multi-map all over the genome prior to alignment.</p> <p>STAR13 is used to align reads to the reference genome.

In the second pass of STAR, the splice-junctions detected in the first pass are inserted into the genome indices prior to alignment.</p> <p>RSEM14 is used to quantify gene and isoform expression. The expected counts from RSEM are merged across samples to create a two counts matrices for gene counts and isoform counts.</p> <p>Arriba15 is used to predict gene-fusion events.

How do I know if RNA-seek finished running successfully?</p> <p>A. There are several different ways of checking the status of each job submitted to the cluster. Here are a few suggestions:</p> <p>Check Job Status</p> Biowulf Dashboard <p>You can check the status of Biowulf jobs through the your user dashboard.</p> <p>Each job that RNA-seek submits to the cluster starts with the <code>pl:</code> prefix.</p> Snakemake Log <p>Snakemake generates the following file, <code>Reports/snakemake.log</code>, in each pipeline's working directory. This file contains information about each job submitted to the job scheduler. If there are no problems, snakemake will report 100% steps done in those last few lines of the file.</p> <p>You can take a peek of the end of the file by running the following command: <pre><code>tail -n30 Reports/snakemake.log\n</code></pre></p> <p>Or more specifically, you can pull out the timestamps of the last few completed jobs like this: <pre><code>grep -A 1 done Reports/snakemake.log | tail\n</code></pre></p> Query Job Scheduler <p>SLURM has built-in commands that allow a user to view the status of jobs submitted to the cluster.</p> <p>Method 1: To see what jobs you have running, run the following command: <pre><code>squeue -u $USER\n</code></pre></p> <p>Method 2 You can also run this alternative command to check the status of your running jobs: <pre><code>sjobs\n</code></pre></p> <p>Each job that RNA-seek submits to the cluster starts with the <code>pl:</code> prefix.</p> <p>Q. How do I identify failed jobs?</p> <p>A. If there are errors, you'll need to identify which jobs failed and check its corresponding SLURM output file. The SLURM output file may contain a clue as to why the job failed.</p> <p>Find Failed Jobs</p> SLURM output files <p>Quick and dirty method to search for failed jobs by looking through each job's output file:</p> <pre><code>grep -i 'fail' slurmfiles/slurm-*.out\n</code></pre> Snakemake Log <p>Bash script identify the SLURM ID of the first failed job and check if the output file exists.</p> <p>Many failures are caused by filesystem or network issues on Biowulf, and in such cases, simply re-starting the Pipeline should resolve the issue. Snakemake will dynamically determine which steps have been completed, and which steps still need to be run. If you are still running into problems after re-running the pipeline, there may be another issue. If that is the case, please feel free to contact us.</p> <p>Q. How do I cancel ongoing RNA-seek jobs?</p> <p>A. Sometimes, you might need to manually stop a RNA-seek run prematurely, perhaps because the run was configured incorrectly or if a job is stalled. Although the walltime limits will eventually stop the workflow, this can take up to 5 or 10 days depending on the pipeline.</p> <p>To stop RNA-seek jobs that are currently running, you can follow these options.</p> <p>Cancel running jobs</p> Master Job <p>You can use the <code>sjobs</code> tool provided by Biowulf to monitor ongoing jobs.</p> <p>Examine the <code>NAME</code> column of the <code>sjobs</code> output, one of them should match <code>pl:rna-seek</code>. This is the \"primary\" job that orchestrates the submission of child jobs as the pipeline completes. Terminating this job will ensure that the pipeline is cancelled; however, you will likely need to unlock the working directory before re-running rna-seek again. Please see our instructions below in <code>Error: Directory cannot be locked</code> for how to unlock a working directory.</p> <p>You can manually cancel the primary job using <code>scancel</code>.</p> <p>However, secondary jobs that are already running will continue to completion (or failure).  To stop them immediately, you will need to run <code>scancel</code> individually for each secondary job. See the next tab for a bash script that tries to automate this process.</p> Child Jobs <p>When there are lots of secondary jobs running, or if you have multiple RNA-seek runs ongoing simultaneously, it's not feasible to manually cancel jobs based on the <code>sjobs</code> output (see previous tab).</p> <p>We provide a script that will parse the snakemake log file and cancel all jobs listed within.</p> <pre><code>## Download the script (to the current directory)\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCBR/Tools/master/Biowulf/cancel_snakemake_jobs.sh\n\n## Run the script\nbash cancel_snakemake_jobs.sh /path/to/output/logfiles/snakemake.log\n</code></pre> <p>The script accepts one argument, which should be the path to the snakemake log file.  This will work for any log output from Snakemake.</p> <p>This script will NOT cancel the primary job, which you will still have to identify and cancel manually, as described in the previous tab.</p> <p>Once you've ensured that all running jobs have been stopped, you need to unlock the working directory (see below), and re-run rna-seek to resume the pipeline.</p>"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#job-errors","title":"Job Errors","text":"<p>Q. Why am I getting <code>sbatch: command not found error</code>?</p> <p>A. Are you running the <code>rna-seek</code> on <code>helix.nih.gov</code> by mistake. Helix does not have a job scheduler. One may be able to fire up the singularity module, initial working directory and perform dry-run on <code>helix</code>. But to submit jobs, you need to log into <code>biowulf</code> using <code>ssh -Y username@biowulf.nih.gov</code>.</p> <p>Q. Why am I getting a message saying <code>Error: Directory cannot be locked. ...</code> when I do the dry-run?</p> <p>A. This is caused when a run is stopped prematurely, either accidentally or on purpose, or the pipeline is still running in your working directory. Snakemake will lock a working directory to prevent two concurrent pipelines from writing to the same location. This can be remedied easily by running <code>rna-seek unlock</code> sub command. Please check to see if the pipeline is still running prior to running the commands below. If you would like to cancel a submitted or running pipeline, please reference the instructions above.</p> <pre><code># Load Dependencies\nmodule load ccbrpipeliner\n\n# Unlock the working directory\nrna-seek unlock --output /path/to/working/dir\n</code></pre> <p>Q. Why am I getting a message saying <code>MissingInputException in line ...</code> when I do the dry-run?</p> <p>A. This error usually occurs when snakemake is terminated ungracefully. Did you forcefully cancel a running pipeline? Or did one of your running pipelines abruptly end? Either way, the solution is straight-forward. Please go to your pipeline's output directory, and rename or delete the following hidden directory: <code>.snakemake/</code>. This directory contains metadata pertaining any snakemake runs inside that working directory. Sometimes when a pipeline is pre-maturely or forcefully terminated, a few files related to tracking temp() files are not deleted and snakemake raises a MissingInputException.</p> <pre><code># Navigate to working directory\ncd /path/to/working/dir\n\n# Rename .snakemake directory to something else\n# And try re-dry running the pipeline\nmv .snakemake .old_snakemake\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"RNA-seq/Resources/","title":"Resources","text":""},{"location":"RNA-seq/Resources/#1-reference-genomes","title":"1.
