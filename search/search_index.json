This guide is the main source of documentation for users that are getting started with the RENEE pipeline . If you are not familiar with RNA-sequencing, please checkout our theory and practical guide . That section provides a conceptual overview to RNA-seq analysis and as well as a set of generalized guidelines to interpret different quality-control metrics. If you are a new user, we highly recommend reading through our getting started section. This page contains information needed to quickly build new reference files and setup the pipeline for running in your compute environment. RENEE is composed several inter-related sub commands to facilitate the analysis of RNA-sequencing data. For more information about each available sub command, please see the usage section . To help out new users, an example of each command is also provided. The resources page contains more information about the pipeline's default reference genomes along with every tool and Docker image the pipeline employs. For more information about issues or trouble-shooting a problem, please checkout our FAQ prior to opening an issue on Github . 2. Overview \u00b6 RENEE is a comprehensive, open-source RNA-seq pipeline that relies on technologies like Docker 1 and Singularity 2 ... now called Apptainer to maintain the highest-level of reproducibility. The pipeline consists of a series of data processing and quality-control steps orchestrated by Snakemake 3 , a flexible and scalable workflow management system, to submit jobs to a cluster or cloud provider (coming soon!). RENEE can be run locally on a compute instance, on-premise using a cluster, or on the cloud using AWS (coming soon!). A user can define the method or mode of execution. The pipeline can submit jobs to a cluster using a job scheduler like SLURM, or run on AWS using Tibanna (feature coming soon!). A hybrid approach ensures the pipeline is accessible to all users. A bioinformatics pipeline is more than the sum of its data processing steps. A pipeline without quality-control steps provides a myopic view of the potential sources of variation within your data (i.e., biological verses technical sources of variation). RENEE pipeline is composed of a series of quality-control and data processing steps. Fig 1. An Overview of the Quantification and Quality-control Pipeline. Gene and isoform counts are quantified and a series of QC-checks are performed to assess the quality of the data. This pipeline stops at the generation of a raw counts matrix, which is input to the next sub-workflow. To run the pipeline, a user must select their raw data directory (i.e. the location to their FastQ files), a reference genome, and output directory (i.e. the location where the pipeline performs the analysis). Quality-control information is summarized across all samples in the MultiQC and RNA report. 3. Pipeline \u00b6 The accuracy of the downstream interpretations made from transcriptomic data are highly dependent on initial sample library. Unwanted sources of technical variation, which if not accounted for properly, can influence the results. In addition to generating a MultiQC report, the RENEE pipeline also generates a rNA Report to interactively allow users to identify problematic samples prior to performing any downstream analysis. RENEE's comprehensive quality-control helps ensure your results are reliable and reproducible across experiments. In the data processing steps, RENEE quantifies gene and isoform expression and predicts gene fusions. Please note that the detection of alternative splicing events and variant calling will be incorporated in a later release. 3.1 Quality Control \u00b6 Quality Control FastQC 4 is used to assess the sequencing quality. FastQC is run twice, before and after adapter trimming. It generates a set of basic statistics to identify problems that can arise during sequencing or library preparation. FastQC will summarize per base and per read QC metrics such as quality scores and GC content. It will also summarize the distribution of sequence lengths and will report the presence of adapter sequences. Kraken2 5 and FastQ Screen 6 are used to screen for various sources of contamination. During the process of sample collection to library preparation, there is a risk for introducing wanted sources of DNA. FastQ Screen compares your sequencing data to a set of different reference genomes to determine if there is contamination. It allows a user to see if the composition of your library matches what you expect. Also, if there are high levels of microbial contamination, Kraken can provide an estimation of the taxonomic composition. Kraken can be used in conjunction with Krona 7 to produce interactive reports. Preseq 8 is used to estimate the complexity of a library for each samples. If the duplication rate is very high, the overall library complexity will be low. Low library complexity could signal an issue with library preparation where very little input RNA was over-amplified or the sample may be degraded. Picard 9 can be used to estimate the duplication rate, and it has another particularly useful sub-command called CollectRNAseqMetrics which reports the number and percentage of reads that align to various regions: such as coding, intronic, UTR, intergenic and ribosomal regions. This is particularly useful as you would expect a library constructed with ploy(A)-selection to have a high percentage of reads that map to coding regions. Picard CollectRNAseqMetrics will also report the uniformity of coverage across all genes, which is useful for determining whether a sample has a 3' bias (observed in ploy(A)-selection libraries containing degraded RNA). RSeQC 10 is another particularity useful package that is tailored for RNA-seq data. It is used to calculate the inner distance between paired-end reads and calculate TIN values for a set of canonical protein-coding transcripts. A median TIN value is calucated for each sample, which analogous to a computationally derived RIN. MultiQC 11 is used to aggregate the results of each tool into a single interactive report. 3.2 Data Processing \u00b6 Cutadapt 12 is used to remove adapter sequences, perform quality trimming, and remove very short sequences that would otherwise multi-map all over the genome prior to alignment. STAR 13 is used to align reads to the reference genome. The RENEE pipeline runs STAR in a two-passes where splice-junctions are collected and aggregated across all samples and provided to the second-pass of STAR. In the second pass of STAR, the splice-junctions detected in the first pass are inserted into the genome indices prior to alignment. RSEM 14 is used to quantify gene and isoform expression. The expected counts from RSEM are merged across samples to create a two counts matrices for gene counts and isoform counts. Arriba 15 is used to predict gene-fusion events. The pre-built human and mouse reference genomes use Arriba blacklists to reduce the false-positive rate. 4.

How do I know if RNA-seek finished running successfully? A. There are several different ways of checking the status of each job submitted to the cluster. Here are a few suggestions: Check Job Status Biowulf Dashboard You can check the status of Biowulf jobs through the your user dashboard . Each job that RNA-seek submits to the cluster starts with the pl: prefix. Snakemake Log Snakemake generates the following file, Reports/snakemake.log , in each pipeline's working directory. This file contains information about each job submitted to the job scheduler. If there are no problems, snakemake will report 100% steps done in those last few lines of the file. You can take a peek of the end of the file by running the following command: tail -n30 Reports/snakemake.log Or more specifically, you can pull out the timestamps of the last few completed jobs like this: grep -A 1 done Reports/snakemake.log | tail Query Job Scheduler SLURM has built-in commands that allow a user to view the status of jobs submitted to the cluster. Method 1: To see what jobs you have running, run the following command: squeue -u $USER Method 2 You can also run this alternative command to check the status of your running jobs: sjobs Each job that RNA-seek submits to the cluster starts with the pl: prefix. Q. How do I identify failed jobs? A. If there are errors, you'll need to identify which jobs failed and check its corresponding SLURM output file. The SLURM output file may contain a clue as to why the job failed. Find Failed Jobs SLURM output files Quick and dirty method to search for failed jobs by looking through each job's output file: grep -i 'fail' slurmfiles/slurm-*.out Snakemake Log Bash script identify the SLURM ID of the first failed job and check if the output file exists. Many failures are caused by filesystem or network issues on Biowulf, and in such cases, simply re-starting the Pipeline should resolve the issue. Snakemake will dynamically determine which steps have been completed, and which steps still need to be run. If you are still running into problems after re-running the pipeline, there may be another issue. If that is the case, please feel free to contact us . Q. How do I cancel ongoing RNA-seek jobs? A. Sometimes, you might need to manually stop a RNA-seek run prematurely, perhaps because the run was configured incorrectly or if a job is stalled. Although the walltime limits will eventually stop the workflow, this can take up to 5 or 10 days depending on the pipeline. To stop RNA-seek jobs that are currently running, you can follow these options. Cancel running jobs Master Job You can use the sjobs tool provided by Biowulf to monitor ongoing jobs. Examine the NAME column of the sjobs output, one of them should match pl:rna-seek . This is the \"primary\" job that orchestrates the submission of child jobs as the pipeline completes. Terminating this job will ensure that the pipeline is cancelled; however, you will likely need to unlock the working directory before re-running rna-seek again. Please see our instructions below in Error: Directory cannot be locked for how to unlock a working directory. You can manually cancel the primary job using scancel . However, secondary jobs that are already running will continue to completion (or failure). To stop them immediately, you will need to run scancel individually for each secondary job. See the next tab for a bash script that tries to automate this process. Child Jobs When there are lots of secondary jobs running, or if you have multiple RNA-seek runs ongoing simultaneously, it's not feasible to manually cancel jobs based on the sjobs output (see previous tab). We provide a script that will parse the snakemake log file and cancel all jobs listed within. ## Download the script (to the current directory) wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCBR/Tools/master/Biowulf/cancel_snakemake_jobs.sh ## Run the script bash cancel_snakemake_jobs.sh /path/to/output/logfiles/snakemake.log The script accepts one argument, which should be the path to the snakemake log file. This will work for any log output from Snakemake. This script will NOT cancel the primary job, which you will still have to identify and cancel manually, as described in the previous tab. Once you've ensured that all running jobs have been stopped, you need to unlock the working directory (see below), and re-run rna-seek to resume the pipeline. Job Errors \u00b6 Q. Why am I getting sbatch: command not found error ? A. Are you running the rna-seek on helix.nih.gov by mistake. Helix does not have a job scheduler. One may be able to fire up the singularity module, initial working directory and perform dry-run on helix . But to submit jobs, you need to log into biowulf using ssh -Y username@biowulf.nih.gov . Q. Why am I getting a message saying Error: Directory cannot be locked. ... when I do the dry-run? A. This is caused when a run is stopped prematurely, either accidentally or on purpose, or the pipeline is still running in your working directory. Snakemake will lock a working directory to prevent two concurrent pipelines from writing to the same location. This can be remedied easily by running rna-seek unlock sub command. Please check to see if the pipeline is still running prior to running the commands below. If you would like to cancel a submitted or running pipeline, please reference the instructions above. # Load Dependencies module load ccbrpipeliner # Unlock the working directory rna-seek unlock --output /path/to/working/dir Q. Why am I getting a message saying MissingInputException in line ... when I do the dry-run? A. This error usually occurs when snakemake is terminated ungracefully. Did you forcefully cancel a running pipeline? Or did one of your running pipelines abruptly end? Either way, the solution is straight-forward. Please go to your pipeline's output directory, and rename or delete the following hidden directory: .snakemake/ . This directory contains metadata pertaining any snakemake runs inside that working directory. Sometimes when a pipeline is pre-maturely or forcefully terminated, a few files related to tracking temp() files are not deleted and snakemake raises a MissingInputException. # Navigate to working directory cd /path/to/working/dir # Rename .snakemake directory to something else # And try re-dry running the pipeline mv .snakemake .old_snakemake","title":"Troubleshooting"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#job-status","text":"Q.

Terminating this job will ensure that the pipeline is cancelled; however, you will likely need to unlock the working directory before re-running rna-seek again. Please see our instructions below in Error: Directory cannot be locked for how to unlock a working directory. You can manually cancel the primary job using scancel . However, secondary jobs that are already running will continue to completion (or failure). To stop them immediately, you will need to run scancel individually for each secondary job. See the next tab for a bash script that tries to automate this process. Child Jobs When there are lots of secondary jobs running, or if you have multiple RNA-seek runs ongoing simultaneously, it's not feasible to manually cancel jobs based on the sjobs output (see previous tab). We provide a script that will parse the snakemake log file and cancel all jobs listed within. ## Download the script (to the current directory) wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCBR/Tools/master/Biowulf/cancel_snakemake_jobs.sh ## Run the script bash cancel_snakemake_jobs.sh /path/to/output/logfiles/snakemake.log The script accepts one argument, which should be the path to the snakemake log file. This will work for any log output from Snakemake. This script will NOT cancel the primary job, which you will still have to identify and cancel manually, as described in the previous tab. Once you've ensured that all running jobs have been stopped, you need to unlock the working directory (see below), and re-run rna-seek to resume the pipeline.","title":"Job Status"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#job-errors","text":"Q. Why am I getting sbatch: command not found error ? A. Are you running the rna-seek on helix.nih.gov by mistake. Helix does not have a job scheduler. One may be able to fire up the singularity module, initial working directory and perform dry-run on helix . But to submit jobs, you need to log into biowulf using ssh -Y username@biowulf.nih.gov . Q. Why am I getting a message saying Error: Directory cannot be locked. ... when I do the dry-run? A. This is caused when a run is stopped prematurely, either accidentally or on purpose, or the pipeline is still running in your working directory. Snakemake will lock a working directory to prevent two concurrent pipelines from writing to the same location. This can be remedied easily by running rna-seek unlock sub command. Please check to see if the pipeline is still running prior to running the commands below. If you would like to cancel a submitted or running pipeline, please reference the instructions above. # Load Dependencies module load ccbrpipeliner # Unlock the working directory rna-seek unlock --output /path/to/working/dir Q. Why am I getting a message saying MissingInputException in line ... when I do the dry-run? A. This error usually occurs when snakemake is terminated ungracefully. Did you forcefully cancel a running pipeline? Or did one of your running pipelines abruptly end? Either way, the solution is straight-forward. Please go to your pipeline's output directory, and rename or delete the following hidden directory: .snakemake/ . This directory contains metadata pertaining any snakemake runs inside that working directory. Sometimes when a pipeline is pre-maturely or forcefully terminated, a few files related to tracking temp() files are not deleted and snakemake raises a MissingInputException. # Navigate to working directory cd /path/to/working/dir # Rename .snakemake directory to something else # And try re-dry running the pipeline mv .snakemake .old_snakemake","title":"Job Errors"},{"location":"RNA-seq/Resources/","text":"1.

These are usually steps like removing adapter sequences, aligning reads against a reference genome, checking the quality of the data, and quantifying counts. RENEE is composed of several sub commands or convenience functions to automate these repetitive steps. With RENEE, you can run your samples through our highly-reproducible pipeline, build resources for new reference genomes, and more! Here is a list of available renee sub commands : run : run the rna-seq pipeline build : build reference files cache : cache remote resources locally unlock : unlock a working directory This page contains information for building reference files and running the RENEE pipeline. For more information about each of the available sub commands, please see the usage section . 2. Setup RENEE \u00b6 Estimated Reading Time: 3 Mintutes RENEE has two dependencies: singularity and snakemake . These dependencies can be installed by a sysadmin; however, snakemake is readily available through conda. Before running the pipeline or any of the commands below, please ensure singularity and snakemake are in your $PATH . Please see follow the instructions below for getting started with the RENEE pipeline. 2.1 Login to cluster \u00b6 # Setup Step 0.) ssh into cluster's head node # example below for Biowulf cluster ssh -Y $USER @biowulf.nih.gov 2.2 Grab an interactive node \u00b6 # Setup Step 1.)

Introduction \u00b6 RNA-sequencing ( RNA-seq ) has a wide variety of applications; this transcriptome profiling method can be used to quantify gene and isoform expression, find changes in alternative splicing, detect gene-fusion events, call variants and much more. It is also worth noting that RNA-seq can be coupled with other biochemical assays to analyze many other aspects of RNA biology, such as RNA\u2013protein binding (CLIP-seq, RIP-seq), RNA structure (SHAPE-seq), or RNA\u2013RNA interactions (CLASH-seq). These applications are, however, beyond the scope of this documentation as we focus on typical RNA-seq project (i.e. quantifying expression and gene fusions). Our focus is to outline current standards and resources for the bioinformatics analysis of RNA-seq data. We do not aim to provide an exhaustive compilation of resources or software tools. Rather, we aim to provide a guideline and conceptual overview for RNA-seq data analysis based on our best-practices RNA-seq pipeline. Here we review all of the typical major steps in RNA-seq data analysis, starting from experimental design, quality control, read alignment, quantification of gene and transcript levels, and visualization. 2. Experimental Design \u00b6 Just like any other scientific experiment, a good RNA-seq experiment is hypothesis-driven. If you cannot describe the problem you are trying to address, throwing NGS at the problem is not a cure-all solution. Fishing for results is a waste of your time and is bad science. As so, designing a well-thought-out experiment around a testable question will maximize the likelihood of generating high-impact results. The data that is generated will determine whether you have the potential to answer your biological question of interest. As a prerequisite, you need to think about how you will construct your libraries; the correct sequencing depth to address your question of interest; the number of replicates, and strategies to reduce/mitigate batch effects. 2.1 Library construction \u00b6 rRNA can comprise up to 80% of the RNA in a cell. An important consideration is the RNA extraction protocol that will be used to remove the highly abundant ribosomal RNA (rRNA). For eukaryotic cells, there are two major considerations: choosing whether to enrich for mRNA or whether to deplete rRNA. 2.1.1 mRNA \u00b6 Poly-(A) selection is a common method used to enrich for mRNA. This method generates the highest percentage of reads which will ultimately map to protein-coding genes-- making it a common choice for most applications. That being said, poly(A)-selection requires your RNA to be of high quality with minimal degradation. Degraded samples that are followed with ploy(A)-selection may result in a 3\u2019 bias, which in effect, may introduce downstream biases into your results. 2.1.2 total RNA \u00b6 The second method captures total RNA through the depletion of rRNA. This method allows you to examine both mRNA and other non-coding RNA species such as lncRNAs. Again, depending on the question you are trying to answer this may be the right method for you. Although, it should be noted that both methods, mRNA and total RNA, require RINs (>8). But if you samples do contain slightly degraded RNA, you might be able to use the total RNA method over poly(A)-selection. 2.2 Sequencing Depth \u00b6 Sequencing depth or library size is another important design factor. As sequencing depth is increased, more transcripts will be detected (up until a saturation point), and their relative abundance will be quantified more accurately. At the end of the day, the targeted sequencing depth depends on the aims of the experiment. Are you trying to quantify differences in gene expression, are you trying to quantify differential isoform usage or alternative splicing events? The numbers quoted below are more or less tailored to quantify differences in gene expression. If you are trying to quantify changes in alternative splicing or isoform regulation, you are going to much higher coverage (~ 100M paired-end reads). 2.2.1 mRNA \u00b6 For mRNA libraries or libraries generated from a prep kit using poly-(A) selection, we recommend a minimum sequencing depth of 10-20M paired-end reads (or 20-40M reads). RNA must be of high quality or a 3' bias may be observed. 2.2.2 total RNA \u00b6 For total RNA libraries, we recommend a sequencing depth of 25-60M paired-end reads (or 50-120M reads). RNA must be of high quality. Note: In the sections above and below, when I say to paired-end reads I am referring to read pairs generated from paired-end sequencing of a given cDNA fragment. You will sometimes see reads reported as pairs of reads or total reads. 2.3 Replicates \u00b6 Another important design factor is the number of replicates. That being said, biological replicates are always preferred over technical replicates. 2.3.1 Recommendation \u00b6 We recommend 4 biological replicates per experimental condition or group. Having more replicates is good for several reasons because in the real world problems arise. If you have a bad sample that cannot be used due to severe QC issues, you are still left with 3 biological replicates. This allows you to drop a bad sample without comprising statistical power downstream. 2.3.2 Bare Minimum \u00b6 If cost is a factor, at a minimum, 3 biological replicates will ensure good statistical power for downstream analysis. 2.4 Reducing Batch Effects \u00b6 Batch effects represent unwanted sources of technical variation. Batch effects introduce non-biological variation into your data, which if not accounted for can influence the results. Through the process of library preparation to sequencing, there are a number of steps (such as RNA extraction to adapter ligation to lane loading, etc.) that might introduce biases into the resulting data. As a general rule of thumb, the best way to reduce the introduction of batch effects is through uniform processing-- meaning you need to ensure that differences in sample handling are minimal. This means that samples should be processed by the same lab technician and everything should be done in a uniform manner. That being said, do not extract your RNA at different times, do not use different lots of reagents! If a large number of samples are being processed and everything cannot be done at the same time, process representative samples from each biological group at the same time. This will ensure that batches and your variable of interest do not become confounded. Also, keep note of which samples belong to each batch. This information will be needed for batch correction. To reduce the possibility of introducing batch effects from sequencing, all samples should be multiplexed together on the same lane(s). Sample Group Batch Batch* Treatment_rep_1 KO 1 1 Treatment_rep_2 KO 2 1 Treatment_rep_3 KO 1 1 Treatment_rep_4 KO 2 1 Control_rep_1 WT 1 2 Control_rep_2 WT 2 2 Control_rep_3 WT 1 2 Control_rep_4 WT 2 2 Batch = properly balanced batches, easily corrected Batch* = groups and batch totally confounded, cannot be corrected That being said, some problems cannot be bioinformatically corrected. If your variable of interest is totally confounded with your batches, applying batch correction to fix the problem is not going to work, and will lead to undesired results (i.e. Batch* column). If batches must be introduced due to other constraining factors, please keep note which samples belong to each batch, and please put some thought into how to properly balance samples across your batches. 3. Quality Control \u00b6 Quality-control ( QC ) is extremely important! As the old adage goes: Garbage in, Garbage out! If there is one thing that to take away from this document, let it be that. Performing QC checks will help ensure that your results are reliable and reproducible. It is worth noting that there is a large variety of open-source tools that can be used to assess the quality of your data so there is no reason to re-invent the wheel. Please keep this in mind but also be aware that there are many wheels per se , and you will need to know which to use and when. In this next section, we will cover different quality-control checks that can be applied at different stages of your RNA-seq analysis. These recommendations are based on a few tools our best-practices RNA-seq pipeline employs. 3.1 Pre-aligment \u00b6 Before drawing biological conclusions, it is important to perform quality control checks to ensure that there are no signs of sequencing error, biases in your data, or other sources of contamination. Modern high-throughput sequencers generate millions of reads per run, and in the real world, problems can arise. The general idea is to assess the quality of your reads before and after adapter removal and to check for different sources of contamination before proceeding to alignment. Here are a few of the tools that we use and recommend. 3.1.1 Sequencing Quality \u00b6 To assess the sequencing quality of your data, we recommend running FastQC before and after adapter trimming. FastQC generates a set of basic statistics to identify problems that can arise during sequencing or library preparation. FastQC will summarize per base and per read QC metrics such as quality scores and GC content (ideally, this plot should have a normal distribution with no forms of bimodality). It will also summarize the distribution of sequence lengths and will report the presence of adapter sequences, which is one reason we run it after removing adapters. 3.1.2 Contamination Screening \u00b6 During the process of sample collection to library preparation, there is a risk for introducing wanted sources of DNA. FastQ Screen compares your sequencing data to a set of different reference genomes to determine if there is contamination. It allows a user to see if the composition of your library matches what you expect. If your data has high levels of human, mouse, fungi, or bacterial contamination, FastQ Screen will tell you. FastQ Screen will tell you what percentage of your library aligns against different reference genomes. If there are high levels of microbial contamination, Kraken will provide an estimation of the taxonomic composition. Kraken can be used in conjunction with Krona to produce interactive reports. Note: Due to high levels of homology between organisms, there may be a small portion of your reads that align to an unexpected reference genome. Again, this should be a minimal percentage of your reads. 3.2 Post-alignment \u00b6 Again, there are many tools available to assess the quality of your data post-alignment, and as stated before, there is no need to re-invent the wheel. Please see the table below for a generalized set of guidelines for different pre/post QC metrics. 3.2.1 Library Complexity \u00b6 Preseq can be used to estimate the complexity of a library for each of your samples. If the duplication rate is very high, the overall library complexity will be low. Low library complexity could signal an issue with library preparation or sample preparation (FFPE samples) where very little input RNA was over-amplified or the sample may be degraded. 3.2.2 Library Composition \u00b6 Picard has a particularly useful sub-command called CollectRNAseqMetrics which reports the number and percentage of reads that align to various regions: such as coding, intronic, UTR, intergenic and ribosomal regions. This is particularly useful as you would expect a library constructed with ploy(A)-selection to have a high percentage of reads that map to coding regions. Picard CollectRNAseqMetrics will also report the uniformity of coverage across all genes, which is useful for determining whether a sample has a 3' bias (observed in libraries containing degraded RNA). 3.2.3 RNA Quality \u00b6 This is another particularity useful package that is tailored for RNA-seq data. The package is made up of over 20 sub-module that can be used to do things like calculate the average insert size between paired-end reads (which is useful for GEO upload), annotate the percentage of reads spanning known or novel splice junctions, convert a BAM file into a normalized BigWig file, and infer RNA quality. 3.3 Guidelines \u00b6 Here is a set of generalized guidelines for different QC metrics. Some of these metrics will vary genome-to-genome depending on the quality of the assembly and annotation but that has been taken into consideration for our set of supported reference genomes. QC Metric Guidelines mRNA total RNA RNA Type(s) Coding Coding + non-coding RIN >= 8 [low RIN ~ 3' bias] >= 8 Single-end vs Paired-end Paired-end Paired-end Sequencing Depth 10-20M PE reads 25-60M PE reads FastQC Q30 > 70% Q30 > 70% Percent Aligned to Reference > 70% > 65% Million Reads Aligned Reference > 7M PE reads > 16.5M PE reads Percent Aligned to rRNA < 5% < 15% Picard RNAseqMetrics Coding > 50% Coding > 35% Picard RNAseqMetrics Intronic + Intergenic < 25% Intronic + Intergenic < 40% RSeQC TIN medTIN > 65 medTIN > 60 The median TIN value reported by RSeQC works reasonably well for quickly identifying problematic samples. 4. Data Processing \u00b6 Starting from raw data (FastQ files), how do we get a raw counts matrix, or how do we get a list of differential expressed genes? Before feeding your data into an R package for differential expression analysis, it needs to be processed to add biological context to it. In this section, we will talk about the data processing pipeline in more detail-- more specifically focusing on primary and secondary analysis. 4.1 Primary Analysis \u00b6 Raw data > Adapter Trimming > Alignment > Quantification 4.1.1 Adapter Trimming \u00b6 One of the first steps in this process is to remove any unwanted adapters sequences from your reads in before alignment. Adapters are composed of synthetic sequences and should be removed prior to alignment. Adapter removal is especially important in certain protocols, such as miRNA-seq. When smaller fragments are sequenced it is almost certain there will be some form of adapter contamination. 4.1.2 Alignment \u00b6 In the alignment step, we add biological context to the raw data. In this step, we align reads to the reference genome to find where the sequenced fragments originate. Accurate alignment of the cDNA fragments (which are derived from RNA) is difficult. Alternative splicing introduces the problem of aligning to non-contiguous regions, and using traditional genomic alignment algorithms can produce inaccurate or low-quality alignments due to the combination of alternative splicing and genomic variation (substitutions, insertions, and deletions). This has lead to the development of splice-aware aligners like STAR, which are designed to overcome these issues. STAR can also be run in a two-pass mode for enhanced detection of reads mapping to novel splice junctions. 4.1.3 Quantification \u00b6 In the quantification step, the number of reads that mapped to a particular genomic feature (such as a gene or isoform) is counted. It is important to keep in mind that raw counts are biased by a number of factors such as library size, feature-length, and other compositional biases. As so, it is important to normalize your data to remove these biases before summarizing differences between groups of samples.","title":"Theory"},{"location":"RNA-seq/Theory/#1-introduction","text":"RNA-sequencing ( RNA-seq ) has a wide variety of applications; this transcriptome profiling method can be used to quantify gene and isoform expression, find changes in alternative splicing, detect gene-fusion events, call variants and much more.

With minimal configuration, the build sub command enables you to build new reference files for the renee run pipeline. Setting up the RENEE build pipeline is fast and easy! In its most basic form, renee build only has five required inputs . 2. Synopsis \u00b6 $ renee build [--help] \\ [--shared-resources SHARED_RESOURCES] [--small-genome] \\ [--dry-run] [--singularity-cache SINGULARITY_CACHE] \\ [--sif-cache SIF_CACHE] [--tmp-dir TMP_DIR] \\ --ref-fa REF_FA \\ --ref-name REF_NAME \\ --ref-gtf REF_GTF \\ --gtf-ver GTF_VER \\ --output OUTPUT The synopsis for each command shows its parameters and their usage. Optional parameters are shown in square brackets. A user must provide the genomic sequence of the reference's assembly in FASTA format via --ref-fa argument, an alias for the reference genome via --ref-name argument, a gene annotation for the reference assembly via --ref-gtf argument, an alias or version for the gene annotation via the --gtf-ver argument, and an output directory to store the built reference files via --output argument. If you are running the pipeline outside of Biowulf, you will need to additionally provide the the following options: --shared-resources , --tmp-dir . More information about each of these options can be found below. For human and mouse data, we highly recommend downloading the latest available PRI genome assembly and corresponding gene annotation from GENCODE . These reference files contain chromosomes and scaffolds sequences. The build pipeline will generate a JSON file containing key, value pairs to required reference files for the renee run pipeline. This file will be located in the path provided to --output . The name of this JSON file is dependent on the values provided to --ref-name and --gtf-ver and has the following naming convention: {OUTPUT}/{REF_NAME}_{GTF_VER}.json . Once the build pipeline completes, this reference JSON file can be passed to the --genome option of renee run . This is how new references are built for the RENEE pipeline. Use you can always use the -h option for information on a specific command. 2.1 Required Arguments \u00b6 Each of the following arguments are required. Failure to provide a required argument will result in a non-zero exit-code. --ref-fa REF_FA Genomic FASTA file of the reference genome. type: file This file represents the genome sequence of the reference assembly in FASTA format. If you are downloading this from GENCODE, you should select the PRI genomic FASTA file. This file will contain the primary genomic assembly (contains chromosomes and scaffolds). This input file should not be compressed. Sequence identifiers in this file must match with sequence identifiers in the GTF file provided to --ref-gtf . Example: > --ref-fa GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.fa --ref-name REF_NAME Name of the reference genome. type: string Name or alias for the reference genome. This can be the common name for the reference genome. Here is a list of common examples for different model organisms: mm10, hg38, rn6, danRer11, dm6, canFam3, sacCer3, ce11. If the provided values contains one of the following sub-strings (hg19, hs37d, grch37, hg38, hs38d, grch38, mm10, grcm38), then Arriba will run with its corresponding blacklist. Example: --ref-name hg38 --ref-gtf REF_GTF Gene annotation or GTF file for the reference genome. type: file This file represents the reference genome's gene annotation in GTF format. If you are downloading this from GENCODE, you should select the 'PRI' GTF file. This file contains gene annotations for the primary assembly (contains chromosomes and scaffolds). This input file should not be compressed. Sequence identifiers (column 1) in this file must match with sequence identifiers in the FASTA file provided to --ref-fa . Example: --ref-gtf gencode.v36.primary_assembly.annotation.gtf --gtf-ver GTF_VER Version of the gene annotation or GTF file provided. type: string or int This is the version of the supplied gene annotation or GTF file. If you are using a GTF file from GENCODE, use the release number or version (i.e. M25 for mouse or 37 for human). Visit gencodegenes.org for more details. Example: --gtf-ver 36 --output OUTPUT Path to an output directory. type: path This location is where the build pipeline will create all of its output files. If the user-provided working directory has not been initialized, it will automatically be created. Note: by default, any files in config , resources, or workflow in the output directory may be overwritten by renee build . Example: --output /data/$USER/refs/hg38_v36/ 2.2 Build Options \u00b6 Each of the following arguments are optional and do not need to be provided. If you are running the pipeline outside of Biowulf, the --shared-resources option only needs to be provided at least once. This will ensure reference files that are shared across different genomes are downloaded locally. --shared-resources SHARED_RESOURCES Local path to shared resources. type: path The pipeline uses a set of shared reference files that can be re-used across reference genomes. These currently include reference files for kraken and FQScreen. These reference files can be downloaded with the build sub command's --shared-resources option. With that being said, these files only need to be downloaded once. We recommend storing this files in a shared location on the filesystem that other people can access. If you are running the pipeline on Biowulf, you do NOT need to download these reference files! They already exist on the filesystem in a location that anyone can access; however, if you are running the pipeline on another cluster or target system, you will need to download the shared resources with the build sub command, and you will need to provide this option every time you run the pipeline. Please provide the same path that was provided to the build sub command's --shared-resources option. Again, if you are running the pipeline on Biowulf, you do NOT need to provide this option. For more information about how to download shared resources, please reference the build sub command's --shared-resources option. Example: --shared-resources /data/shared/renee --small-genome Builds a small genome index. type: boolean For small genomes, it is recommended running STAR with a scaled down --genomeSAindexNbases value. This option runs the build pipeline in a mode where it dynamically finds the optimal value for this option using the following formula: min(14, log2(GenomeSize)/2 - 1) . Generally speaking, this option is not really applicable for most mammalian reference genomes, i.e. human and mouse; however, researcher working with very small reference genomes, like S. cerevisiae ~ 12Mb, should provide this option. When in doubt feel free to provide this option, as the optimal value will be found based on your input. Example: --small-genome 2.3 Orchestration Options \u00b6 --dry-run Dry run the build pipeline. type: boolean Displays what steps in the build pipeline remain or will be run. Does not execute anything! Example: --dry-run --singularity-cache SINGULARITY_CACHE Overrides the $SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR environment variable. type: path default: --output OUTPUT/.singularity Singularity will cache image layers pulled from remote registries. This ultimately speeds up the process of pull an image from DockerHub if an image layer already exists in the singularity cache directory. By default, the cache is set to the value provided to the --output argument. Please note that this cache cannot be shared across users. Singularity strictly enforces you own the cache directory and will return a non-zero exit code if you do not own the cache directory! See the --sif-cache option to create a shareable resource. Example: --singularity-cache /data/$USER/.singularity --sif-cache SIF_CACHE Path where a local cache of SIFs are stored. type: path Uses a local cache of SIFs on the filesystem. This SIF cache can be shared across users if permissions are set correctly. If a SIF does not exist in the SIF cache, the image will be pulled from Dockerhub and a warning message will be displayed. The renee cache subcommand can be used to create a local SIF cache. Please see renee cache for more information. This command is extremely useful for avoiding DockerHub pull rate limits. It also remove any potential errors that could occur due to network issues or DockerHub being temporarily unavailable. We recommend running RENEE with this option when ever possible. Example: --singularity-cache /data/$USER/SIFs --tmp-dir TMP_DIR Path on the file system for writing temporary files. type: path default: /lscratch/$SLURM_JOBID Path on the file system for writing temporary output files. By default, the temporary directory is set to '/lscratch/$SLURM_JOBID' on NIH's Biowulf cluster and 'OUTPUT' on the FRCE cluster. However, if you are running the pipeline on another cluster, this option will need to be specified. Ideally, this path should point to a dedicated location on the filesystem for writing tmp files. On many systems, this location is set to somewhere in /scratch. If you need to inject avariable into this string that should NOT be expanded,please quote this options value in single quotes. Example: --tmp-dir /cluster_scratch/$USER/ 2.4 Misc Options \u00b6 Each of the following arguments are optional and do not need to be provided. -h, --help Display Help. type: boolean Shows command's synopsis, help message, and an example command Example: --help 3. Hybrid Genomes \u00b6 If you have two GTF files, e.g. hybrid genomes (host + virus), then you need to create one genomic FASTA file and one GTF file for the hybrid genome prior to running the renee build command. We recommend creating an artificial chromosome for the non-host sequence. The sequence identifier in the FASTA file must match the sequence identifier in the GTF file (column 1). Generally speaking, since the host annotation is usually downloaded from Ensembl or GENCODE, it will be correctly formatted; however, that may not be the case for the non-host sequence! Please ensure the non-host annotation contains the following features and/or constraints: for a given gene feature each gene entry has at least one transcript feature and each transcript entry has at least one exon feature gene_id , gene_name and gene_biotype are required for a given transcipt feature along with gene_id , gene_name and gene_biotype ... transcript_id is also required for a given exon feature gene_id , gene_name , gene_biotype , transcript_id are required If not, the GTF file may need to be manually curated until these conditions are satisfied. Here is an example feature from a hand-curated Biotyn_probe GTF file: Biot1 BiotynProbe gene 1 21 0 .000000 + . gene_id \"Biot1\" ; gene_name \"Biot1\" ; gene_biotype \"biotynlated_probe_control\" ; Biot1 BiotynProbe transcript 1 21 0 .000000 + . gene_id \"Biot1\" ; gene_name \"Biot1\" ; gene_biotype \"biotynlated_probe_control\" ; transcript_id \"Biot1\" ; transcript_name \"Biot1\" ; transcript_type \"biotynlated_probe_control\" ; Biot1 BiotynProbe exon 1 21 0 .000000 + . gene_id \"Biot1\" ; gene_biotype \"biotynlated_probe_control\" ; transcript_id \"Biot1\" ; transcript_type \"biotynlated_probe_control\" ; In this tab-delimited example above, line 1: the gene feature has 3 required attributes in column 9: gene_id and gene_name and gene_biotype line 2: the transcript entry for the above gene repeats the same attributes with following required fields: transcript_id and transcript_name Please note: transcript_type is optional line 3: the exon entry for the above transcript has 3 required attributes: gene_id and transcript_id and gene_biotype Please note: transcript_type is optional For a given gene, the combination of the gene_id AND gene_name should form a unique string. There should be no instances where two different genes share the same gene_id AND gene_name . 4. Convert NCBI GFF3 to GTF format \u00b6 It is worth noting that RENEE comes bundled with a script to convert GFF3 files downloaded from NCBI to GTF file format. This convenience script is useful as the renee build sub command takes a GTF file as one of its inputs. Please note that this script has only been tested with GFF3 files downloaded from NCBI, and it is not recommended to use with GFF3 files originating from other sources like Ensembl or GENCODE . If you are selecting an annotation from Ensembl or GENCODE, please download the GTF file option. The only dependency of the script is the python package argparse, which comes bundled with the following python\u2154 distributions: python>=2.7.18 or python>=3.2 . If argparse is not installed, it can be downloaded with pip by running the following command: pip install --upgrade pip pip install argparse For more information about the script and its usage, please run: ./resources/gff3togtf.py -h 5. Example \u00b6 5.1 Biowulf \u00b6 On Biowulf getting started with the pipeline is fast and easy! In this example, we build a mouse reference genome. # Step 0.)

Please note when running the build sub command for the first time, you will also need to provide the --shared-resources option. This option will download our kraken2 database and bowtie2 indices for FastQ Screen. The path provided to this option should be provided to the --shared-resources option of the run sub command. Next, you will also need to provide a path to write temporary output files via the --tmp-dir option. We also recommend providing a path to a SIF cache. You can cache software containers locally with the cache sub command. # Step 0.) Grab an interactive node (do not run on head node) srun -N 1 -n 1 --time = 2 :00:00 -p interactive --mem = 8gb --cpus-per-task = 4 --pty bash # Add snakemake and singularity to $PATH, # This step may vary across clusters, you # can reach out to a sys admin if snakemake # and singularity are not installed. module purge # Replace the following: # module load ccbrpipeliner # with module load statements that load # python >= 3.7, # snakemake, and # singularity # before running renee # Also, ensure that the `renee` executable is in PATH # Step 1.)

About \u00b6 The renee executable is composed of several inter-related sub commands. Please see renee -h for all available options. This part of the documentation describes options and concepts for renee cache sub command in more detail. With minimal configuration, the cache sub command enables you to cache remote resources for the RENEE pipeline. Caching remote resources allows the pipeline to run in an offline mode. renee cache when run successfully submits a SLURM job to the job schedule and quits. squeue can then be used to track the progress of the caching. The cache sub command creates local cache on the filesysytem for resources hosted on DockerHub or AWS S3. These resources are normally pulled onto the filesystem when the pipeline runs; however, due to network issues or DockerHub pull rate limits, it may make sense to pull the resources once so a shared cache can be created and re-used. It is worth noting that a singularity cache cannot normally be shared across users. Singularity strictly enforces that its cache is owned by the user. To get around this issue, the cache subcommand can be used to create local SIFs on the filesystem from images on DockerHub. Caching remote resources for the RENEE pipeline is fast and easy!

Please see renee -h for all available options. This part of the documentation describes options and concepts for renee run sub command in more detail. With minimal configuration, the run sub command enables you to start running the data processing and quality-control pipeline. Setting up the RENEE pipeline is fast and easy! In its most basic form, renee run only has three required inputs . 2. Synopsis \u00b6 $ renee run [--help] \\ [--small-rna] [--star-2-pass-basic] \\ [--dry-run] [--mode {slurm, local}] \\ [--shared-resources SHARED_RESOURCES] \\ [--singularity-cache SINGULARITY_CACHE] \\ [--sif-cache SIF_CACHE] \\ [--tmp-dir TMP_DIR] \\ [--threads THREADS] \\ --input INPUT [INPUT ...] \\ --output OUTPUT \\ --genome {hg38_30, mm10_M21} The synopsis for each command shows its parameters and their usage. Optional parameters are shown in square brackets. A user must provide a list of FastQ files (globbing is supported) to analyze via --input argument, an output directory to store results via --output argument and select reference genome for alignment and annotation via the --genome argument. If you are running the pipeline outside of Biowulf, you will need to additionally provide the the following options: --shared-resources , --tmp-dir . More information about each of these options can be found below. Use you can always use the -h option for information on a specific sub command. 2.1 Required Arguments \u00b6 Each of the following arguments are required. Failure to provide a required argument will result in a non-zero exit-code. --input INPUT [INPUT ...] Input FastQ file(s) to process. type: file One or more FastQ files can be provided. From the command-line, each FastQ file should separated by a space. Globbing is supported! This makes selecting FastQ files easier. Input FastQ files should be gzipp-ed. The pipeline supports single-end and pair-end RNA-seq data; however, the pipeline will not process a mixture of single-end and paired-end samples together. If you have a mixture of single-end and pair-end samples to process, please process them as two separate instances of the RENEE pipeline (with two separate output directories). Example: --input .tests/*.R?.fastq.gz --output OUTPUT Path to an output directory. type: path This location is where the pipeline will create all of its output files, also known as the pipeline's working directory. If the provided output directory does not exist, it will be initialized automatically. Example: --output /data/$USER/RNA_hg38 --genome {hg38_30,mm10_M21,custom.json} Reference genome. type: string or file This option defines the reference genome for your set of samples. On Biowulf, RENEE does comes bundled with pre built reference files for human and mouse samples; however, it is worth noting that the pipeline does accept a custom reference genome built with the build sub command. Building a new reference genome is easy! You can create a custom reference genome with a single command. This is extremely useful when working with non-model organisms. New users can reference the documentation's getting started section to see how a reference genome is built. Pre built Option Pre build genomes are available with RENEE. Please see the resources page for more information about each pre built option. Custom Option A user can also supply a custom reference genome built with the build sub command. Please supply the custom reference JSON file that was generated by the build sub command. The name of this custom reference JSON file is dependent on the values provided to the following renee build args, --ref-name REF_NAME and --gtf-ver GTF_VER , where the name of the provided custom reference JSON file would be: {REF_NAME}_{GTF_VER}.json . Example: --genome hg38_30 OR --genome /data/${USER}/hg38_36/hg38_36.json 2.2 Analysis Options \u00b6 --small-rna Run STAR using ENCODE's recommendations for small RNA. type: boolean This option should only be used with small RNA libraries. These are rRNA-depleted libraries that have been size selected to contain fragments shorter than 200bp. Size selection enriches for small RNA species such as miRNAs, siRNAs, or piRNAs. Also, this option should not be combined with the star 2-pass basic option. If the two options are combined, STAR will run in pass basic mode. This means that STAR will not run with ENCODE's recommendations for small RNA alignment. As so, please take caution not to combine both options together. Please note: This option is only supported with single-end data. Example: --small-rna --star-2-pass-basic Run STAR in per sample 2-pass mapping mode. type: boolean It is recommended to use this option when processing a set of unrelated samples or when processing samples in a clinical setting. It is not adivsed to use this option for a study with multiple related samples. By default, the pipeline ultilizes a multi sample 2-pass mapping approach where the set of splice junctions detected across all samples are provided to the second pass of STAR. This option overrides the default behavior so each sample will be processed in a per sample two-pass basic mode. This option should not be combined with the small RNA option. If the two options are combined, STAR will run in pass basic mode. Example: --star-2-pass-basic 2.3 Orchestration Options \u00b6 Each of the following arguments are optional and do not need to be provided. --dry-run Dry run the pipeline. type: boolean Displays what steps in the pipeline remain or will be run. Does not execute anything! Example: --dry-run --mode {slurm,local} Execution Method. > type: string default: slurm Execution Method. Defines the mode or method of execution. Valid mode options include: slurm or local. local Local executions will run serially on compute instance. This is useful for testing, debugging, or when a users does not have access to a high performance computing environment. If this option is not provided, it will default to a local execution mode. slurm The slurm execution method will submit jobs to a cluster using a slurm + singularity backend. This method will automatically submit the master job to the cluster. It is recommended running RENEE in this mode as execution will be significantly faster in a distributed environment. Example: --mode slurm --shared-resources SHARED_RESOURCES Local path to shared resources. type: path The pipeline uses a set of shared reference files that can be re-used across reference genomes. These currently include reference files for kraken and FQScreen. These reference files can be downloaded with the build sub command's --shared-resources option. With that being said, these files only need to be downloaded once. We recommend storing this files in a shared location on the filesystem that other people can access. If you are running the pipeline on Biowulf, you do NOT need to download these reference files! They already exist on the filesystem in a location that anyone can access; however, if you are running the pipeline on another cluster or target system, you will need to download the shared resources with the build sub command, and you will need to provide this option every time you run the pipeline. Please provide the same path that was provided to the build sub command's --shared-resources option. Again, if you are running the pipeline on Biowulf, you do NOT need to provide this option. For more information about how to download shared resources, please reference the build sub command's --shared-resources option. Example: --shared-resources /data/shared/renee --singularity-cache SINGULARITY_CACHE Overrides the $SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR environment variable. type: path default: --output OUTPUT/.singularity Singularity will cache image layers pulled from remote registries. This ultimately speeds up the process of pull an image from DockerHub if an image layer already exists in the singularity cache directory. By default, the cache is set to the value provided to the --output argument. Please note that this cache cannot be shared across users. Singularity strictly enforces you own the cache directory and will return a non-zero exit code if you do not own the cache directory! See the --sif-cache option to create a shareable resource. Example: --singularity-cache /data/$USER/.singularity --sif-cache SIF_CACHE Path where a local cache of SIFs are stored. type: path Uses a local cache of SIFs on the filesystem. This SIF cache can be shared across users if permissions are set correctly. If a SIF does not exist in the SIF cache, the image will be pulled from Dockerhub and a warning message will be displayed. The renee cache subcommand can be used to create a local SIF cache. Please see renee cache for more information. This command is extremely useful for avoiding DockerHub pull rate limits. It also remove any potential errors that could occur due to network issues or DockerHub being temporarily unavailable. We recommend running RENEE with this option when ever possible. Example: --singularity-cache /data/$USER/SIFs --tmp-dir TMP_DIR Path on the file system for writing temporary files. type: path default: /lscratch/$SLURM_JOBID Path on the file system for writing temporary output files. By default, the temporary directory is set to '/lscratch/$SLURM_JOBID' on NIH's Biowulf cluster and 'OUTPUT' on the FRCE cluster. However, if you are running the pipeline on another cluster, this option will need to be specified. Ideally, this path should point to a dedicated location on the filesystem for writing tmp files. On many systems, this location is set to somewhere in /scratch. If you need to inject avariable into this string that should NOT be expanded,please quote this options value in single quotes. Example: --tmp-dir '/cluster_scratch/$USER/' --threads THREADS Max number of threads for each process. type: int default: 2 Max number of threads for each process. This option is more applicable when running the pipeline with --mode local . It is recommended setting this value to the maximum number of CPUs available on the host machine. Example: --threads 12 2.4 Misc Options \u00b6 Each of the following arguments are optional and do not need to be provided. -h, --help Display Help. type: boolean Shows command's synopsis, help message, and an example command Example: --help 3. Example \u00b6 3.1 Biowulf \u00b6 On Biowulf getting started with the pipeline is fast and easy! The pipeline comes bundled with pre-built human and mouse reference genomes. In the example below, we will use the pre-built human reference genome. # Step 0.)

Before getting started, you will need to build reference files for the pipeline. Please note when running the build sub command for the first time, you will also need to provide the --shared-resources option. This option will download our kraken2 database and bowtie2 indices for FastQ Screen. The path provided to this option should be provided to the --shared-resources option of the run sub command. Next, you will also need to provide a path to write temporary output files via the --tmp-dir option. We also recommend providing a path to a SIF cache. You can cache software containers locally with the cache sub command. # Step 0.) Grab an interactive node (do not run on head node) srun -N 1 -n 1 --time = 2 :00:00 -p interactive --mem = 8gb --cpus-per-task = 4 --pty bash # Add snakemake and singularity to $PATH, # This step may vary across clusters, you # can reach out to a sys admin if snakemake # and singularity are not installed. module purge # Replace the following: # module load ccbrpipeliner # with module load statements that load # python >= 3.7, # snakemake, and # singularity # before running renee # Also, ensure that the `renee` execulable is in PATH # Step 1.)

A user must provide a list of FastQ files (globbing is supported) to analyze via --input argument, an output directory to store results via --output argument and select reference genome for alignment and annotation via the --genome argument. If you are running the pipeline outside of Biowulf, you will need to additionally provide the the following options: --shared-resources , --tmp-dir . More information about each of these options can be found below. Use you can always use the -h option for information on a specific sub command.","title":"2. Synopsis"},{"location":"RNA-seq/run/#21-required-arguments","text":"Each of the following arguments are required. Failure to provide a required argument will result in a non-zero exit-code. --input INPUT [INPUT ...] Input FastQ file(s) to process. type: file One or more FastQ files can be provided. From the command-line, each FastQ file should separated by a space. Globbing is supported! This makes selecting FastQ files easier. Input FastQ files should be gzipp-ed. The pipeline supports single-end and pair-end RNA-seq data; however, the pipeline will not process a mixture of single-end and paired-end samples together. If you have a mixture of single-end and pair-end samples to process, please process them as two separate instances of the RENEE pipeline (with two separate output directories). Example: --input .tests/*.R?.fastq.gz --output OUTPUT Path to an output directory. type: path This location is where the pipeline will create all of its output files, also known as the pipeline's working directory. If the provided output directory does not exist, it will be initialized automatically. Example: --output /data/$USER/RNA_hg38 --genome {hg38_30,mm10_M21,custom.json} Reference genome. type: string or file This option defines the reference genome for your set of samples. On Biowulf, RENEE does comes bundled with pre built reference files for human and mouse samples; however, it is worth noting that the pipeline does accept a custom reference genome built with the build sub command. Building a new reference genome is easy! You can create a custom reference genome with a single command. This is extremely useful when working with non-model organisms. New users can reference the documentation's getting started section to see how a reference genome is built. Pre built Option Pre build genomes are available with RENEE. Please see the resources page for more information about each pre built option. Custom Option A user can also supply a custom reference genome built with the build sub command. Please supply the custom reference JSON file that was generated by the build sub command. The name of this custom reference JSON file is dependent on the values provided to the following renee build args, --ref-name REF_NAME and --gtf-ver GTF_VER , where the name of the provided custom reference JSON file would be: {REF_NAME}_{GTF_VER}.json . Example: --genome hg38_30 OR --genome /data/${USER}/hg38_36/hg38_36.json","title":"2.1 Required Arguments"},{"location":"RNA-seq/run/#22-analysis-options","text":"--small-rna Run STAR using ENCODE's recommendations for small RNA. type: boolean This option should only be used with small RNA libraries. These are rRNA-depleted libraries that have been size selected to contain fragments shorter than 200bp. Size selection enriches for small RNA species such as miRNAs, siRNAs, or piRNAs. Also, this option should not be combined with the star 2-pass basic option. If the two options are combined, STAR will run in pass basic mode. This means that STAR will not run with ENCODE's recommendations for small RNA alignment. As so, please take caution not to combine both options together. Please note: This option is only supported with single-end data. Example: --small-rna --star-2-pass-basic Run STAR in per sample 2-pass mapping mode. type: boolean It is recommended to use this option when processing a set of unrelated samples or when processing samples in a clinical setting. It is not adivsed to use this option for a study with multiple related samples. By default, the pipeline ultilizes a multi sample 2-pass mapping approach where the set of splice junctions detected across all samples are provided to the second pass of STAR. This option overrides the default behavior so each sample will be processed in a per sample two-pass basic mode. This option should not be combined with the small RNA option. If the two options are combined, STAR will run in pass basic mode. Example: --star-2-pass-basic","title":"2.2 Analysis Options"},{"location":"RNA-seq/run/#23-orchestration-options","text":"Each of the following arguments are optional and do not need to be provided. --dry-run Dry run the pipeline. type: boolean Displays what steps in the pipeline remain or will be run. Does not execute anything! Example: --dry-run --mode {slurm,local} Execution Method. > type: string default: slurm Execution Method. Defines the mode or method of execution. Valid mode options include: slurm or local. local Local executions will run serially on compute instance. This is useful for testing, debugging, or when a users does not have access to a high performance computing environment. If this option is not provided, it will default to a local execution mode. slurm The slurm execution method will submit jobs to a cluster using a slurm + singularity backend. This method will automatically submit the master job to the cluster. It is recommended running RENEE in this mode as execution will be significantly faster in a distributed environment. Example: --mode slurm --shared-resources SHARED_RESOURCES Local path to shared resources. type: path The pipeline uses a set of shared reference files that can be re-used across reference genomes. These currently include reference files for kraken and FQScreen. These reference files can be downloaded with the build sub command's --shared-resources option. With that being said, these files only need to be downloaded once. We recommend storing this files in a shared location on the filesystem that other people can access. If you are running the pipeline on Biowulf, you do NOT need to download these reference files! They already exist on the filesystem in a location that anyone can access; however, if you are running the pipeline on another cluster or target system, you will need to download the shared resources with the build sub command, and you will need to provide this option every time you run the pipeline. Please provide the same path that was provided to the build sub command's --shared-resources option. Again, if you are running the pipeline on Biowulf, you do NOT need to provide this option. For more information about how to download shared resources, please reference the build sub command's --shared-resources option. Example: --shared-resources /data/shared/renee --singularity-cache SINGULARITY_CACHE Overrides the $SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR environment variable. type: path default: --output OUTPUT/.singularity Singularity will cache image layers pulled from remote registries. This ultimately speeds up the process of pull an image from DockerHub if an image layer already exists in the singularity cache directory. By default, the cache is set to the value provided to the --output argument. Please note that this cache cannot be shared across users. Singularity strictly enforces you own the cache directory and will return a non-zero exit code if you do not own the cache directory! See the --sif-cache option to create a shareable resource. Example: --singularity-cache /data/$USER/.singularity --sif-cache SIF_CACHE Path where a local cache of SIFs are stored. type: path Uses a local cache of SIFs on the filesystem. This SIF cache can be shared across users if permissions are set correctly. If a SIF does not exist in the SIF cache, the image will be pulled from Dockerhub and a warning message will be displayed. The renee cache subcommand can be used to create a local SIF cache. Please see renee cache for more information. This command is extremely useful for avoiding DockerHub pull rate limits. It also remove any potential errors that could occur due to network issues or DockerHub being temporarily unavailable. We recommend running RENEE with this option when ever possible. Example: --singularity-cache /data/$USER/SIFs --tmp-dir TMP_DIR Path on the file system for writing temporary files. type: path default: /lscratch/$SLURM_JOBID Path on the file system for writing temporary output files. By default, the temporary directory is set to '/lscratch/$SLURM_JOBID' on NIH's Biowulf cluster and 'OUTPUT' on the FRCE cluster. However, if you are running the pipeline on another cluster, this option will need to be specified. Ideally, this path should point to a dedicated location on the filesystem for writing tmp files. On many systems, this location is set to somewhere in /scratch. If you need to inject avariable into this string that should NOT be expanded,please quote this options value in single quotes. Example: --tmp-dir '/cluster_scratch/$USER/' --threads THREADS Max number of threads for each process. type: int default: 2 Max number of threads for each process. This option is more applicable when running the pipeline with --mode local . It is recommended setting this value to the maximum number of CPUs available on the host machine.
